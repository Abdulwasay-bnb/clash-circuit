# Making the fighters in VRoid Studio

The game loads any VRM 1.0 file saved as `characters/<id>/model.vrm` automatically.
Fighter ids: `vex`, `bastion`, `sora`, `ember`, `mara`, `lio`, `tao`, `kael`.

## Steps (about 15–30 minutes per fighter)
1. Open VRoid Studio and click **Create New**.
2. Pick the **Masculine** or **Feminine** base, then shape the body under **Body**.
3. Style the face, hair and outfit with the briefs below.
4. Click **Export** (the share icon at the top right) → **Export as VRM** → choose **VRM 1.0**.
5. When asked for the avatar info, fill in a title and author. Set **"Violent acts using the avatar" = Allow**.
6. Save it to the fighter's folder, for example:
   `~/Documents/clash-circuit-godot/characters/kael/model.vrm`
7. Launch the game. That fighter now uses your model. No code changes are needed.

Tip: keep the polygon reduction in the export dialog at its default. Two fighters on an Intel Iris
Xe run fine with standard VRoid exports.
