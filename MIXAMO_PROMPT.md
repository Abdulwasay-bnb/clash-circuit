You're helping me collect animations from Mixamo (mixamo.com, I'm already logged in) for my 3D fighting game,
"Clash Circuit". The game has 8 original fighters, each with a different martial art. Mixamo's names won't
match what I ask for exactly, so I need you to **use your judgment**: preview the candidates, then pick the
clip that best fits each slot below. Some slots ask for 2–3 options. Quality and believability matter more
than finding an exact name match.

## Download settings (use these for EVERY animation)
- Character: the default **Y Bot**. Don't change the character, so every clip shares one skeleton.
- In the download dialog:
  - Format: **FBX Binary (.fbx)**
  - Skin: **Without Skin**
  - Frames per second: **30**
  - Keyframe reduction: **none**
- If the clip has an **"In Place"** checkbox, **tick it**. My game moves the fighter itself.
- Before downloading, leave the sliders (Overdrive, Character Arm-Space, Trim) at their defaults, unless a
  clip is obviously broken without a tweak. If you change one, say so in the report.
- **First download only:** one reference file of Y Bot **With Skin** (search "T-Pose"). Name it `_reference_tpose`.

## How to pick (your judgment)
- Prefer **clean, single, readable** motions over long combos. Exception: slots marked *combo* or *finisher*.
- Prefer **fighting stance / combat** versions over casual ones, e.g. a fighting idle rather than a relaxed idle.
- For attacks, prefer clips where the hit lands roughly **0.3–0.8 s** into the clip. Very slow wind-ups
  feel bad in a fighting game.
- Skip clips with props (swords, guns), sitting, swimming, or dance moves, unless the slot asks for them.
- Avoid near-duplicates. If two candidates are basically the same, keep the better-looking one.
- If nothing fits a slot well, skip it and write **"no good match"** in the report. Don't force it.

## Slots
Rename each file to the slot name if the browser lets you choose a filename. If it doesn't, keep Mixamo's
name and just list the mapping in the report. `[x2]` / `[x3]` means pick that many different options, named
`_a`, `_b`, `_c`.

### 1. Core movement & reactions (shared by everyone)

| defeated | sad / defeated pose for the loser |

## Report back (very important)
When you're done, or if you hit a limit, reply with a **table** with these columns:

`slot | Mixamo name (exact) | downloaded filename | duration (s) | approx impact time (s) | notes`

- **Impact time** is when the punch or kick fully extends. For non-attacks write `-`.
- In **notes**, mention anything special: it travels forward a lot, has no In Place option, a slider changed, etc.

Also add:
- A list of slots you skipped, with the reason.
- Any **extra clips you found that would look great** in a fighting game but don't fit a slot (up to 10).
  Download them too and name them `extra_<short name>`.

Target: roughly **90–130 downloads**. Pace yourself if Mixamo rate-limits you, and if downloads stop
working, stop and report what you have so far.
